# Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction 

A Machine Learning-based web application for predicting the presence of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) based on clinical parameters. This project utilizes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment using modern tools and techniques.

## Problem Statement

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a serious public health issue that, if not detected early, can lead to permanent kidney failure. This project aims to automate the prediction process using machine learning to help doctors and patients make better decisions.

## Dataset Info

- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository / Kaggle
- **Features**:  
  `age`, `bp`, `sg`, `al`, `su`, `rbc`, `pc`, `pcc`, `ba`, `bgr`, `bu`, `sc`, `sod`, `pot`, `hemo`, `pcv`, `wc`, `rc`, `htn`, `dm`, `cad`, `appet`, `pe`, `ane`, and `classification`.

- **Target**: `classification` → whether the patient has CKD or not

## Machine Learning Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical data
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualizing distributions and relationships
3. **Feature Selection**: Choosing relevant features based on correlation
4. **Model Building**: Training and comparing multiple classifiers
5. **Evaluation**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC
6. **Saving Model**: Using `joblib` or `pickle` for deployment
7. **Deployment**: Web interface using Flask (optional)

## Model Accuracy (Example)

| Model               | Accuracy |
|---------------------|----------|
| Random Forest       | 98%      |
| Logistic Regression | 95%      |
| SVM                 | 94%      |
